Work plan:
Phase 1: Planning and Requirement Gathering (Day 1–4)
Day 1: Initial Planning
•	Define objectives for dynamic pricing (e.g., revenue maximization, class utilization).
•	Identify stakeholders (e.g., fitness center managers, IT teams).
•	Finalize key metrics: demand, time slots, location popularity.
Day 2: Data Collection Plan
•	Determine data sources:
o	Historical attendance and booking data.
o	Customer demographics.
o	External factors like local events or holidays.
•	Design database schema for storing demand, time, and location data.
Day 3: Technology Stack Selection
•	Choose tools for:
o	Backend: Python, Django/Flask, or Node.js.
o	Database: SQLite, PostgreSQL, or MongoDB.
o	Machine Learning: TensorFlow, PyTorch, or scikit-learn.
•	Decide on frontend integration for pricing updates (e.g., React, Angular).
Day 4: Define Pricing Rules
•	Draft initial pricing logic:
o	High-demand surcharge.
o	Off-peak discounts.
o	Location-specific adjustments.

Phase 2: Data Preparation and Analysis (Day 5–8)
Day 5–6: Data Gathering
•	Collect historical booking and attendance data.
•	Gather external data (e.g., holidays, weather trends, local events).
Day 7: Data Cleaning
•	Handle missing or inconsistent data.
•	Normalize data formats (e.g., convert dates and times to standard formats).
Day 8: Data Analysis
•	Identify demand trends, peak hours, and high-popularity locations.
•	Segment data into peak vs. off-peak hours, high-demand vs. low-demand periods.

Phase 3: Machine Learning Model Development (Day 9–12)
Day 9: Model Selection
•	Choose an algorithm for demand prediction:
o	Regression models for demand forecasting.
o	Time series models for trend analysis (e.g., ARIMA, LSTM).
Day 10–11: Model Training
•	Split data into training, validation, and test sets.
•	Train the demand prediction model with historical data.
Day 12: Model Evaluation
•	Evaluate model performance using metrics like RMSE, MAE, or R².
•	Fine-tune hyperparameters for better accuracy.
________________________________________
Phase 4: Pricing Algorithm Implementation (Day 13–15)
Day 13: Develop Pricing Algorithm
•	Implement dynamic pricing logic based on:
o	Predicted demand.
o	Time of day (peak/off-peak hours).
o	Location popularity.
Day 14: Backend Integration
•	Build API endpoints to calculate and serve dynamic prices.
•	Connect the demand prediction model to the pricing API.
Day 15: Frontend Integration
•	Update booking platform to display real-time prices.
•	Highlight pricing changes (e.g., surge pricing, discounts).
________________________________________
Phase 5: Testing and Refinement (Day 16–18)
Day 16: Testing
•	Test the system with sample data to simulate various demand scenarios.
•	Validate that prices are adjusted correctly based on inputs.
Day 17: Feedback Collection
•	Share the prototype with stakeholders.
•	Gather feedback on pricing logic, usability, and user interface.
Day 18: Refinement
•	Address feedback to improve pricing rules and algorithms.
•	Optimize system performance for real-time updates.
________________________________________
Phase 6: Deployment and Monitoring (Day 19–20)
Day 19: Deployment
•	Deploy the system on production servers.
•	Update the booking platform with new pricing features.
Day 20: Monitoring and Optimization
•	Monitor real-time system performance.
•	Analyze booking trends and adjust pricing rules as needed.
